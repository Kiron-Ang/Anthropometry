# Anthropometry

This repository contains code for an analysis I'm working on with Dr. Austin Reynolds in the Department of Anthropology at Baylor University. Dr. Reynolds and his collaborators at other institutions have collected data from a cohort of South Africans, and some of that data includes anthropometric measurements. Here, I analyze measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, and height circumference; I also take into account other variables such as age, birth location, residence location, and more!

``main.R`` is the main script for this project, and it details all processing of the raw data, including quality control steps taken. It also demonstrates the functions used for analyzing the data. Please see the ``notebook`` directory for my notes.

# Required Software
