# Anthropometry

This repository contains code for an analysis I'm working on with Dr. Austin Reynolds in the Department of Anthropology at Baylor University. Dr. Reynolds and his collaborators at other institutions have collected data from a cohort of South Africans, and some of that data includes anthropometric measurements. Here, I analyze measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, and height circumference.
