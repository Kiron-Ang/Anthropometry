After reading Mr. Justin Myrick's reply to my previous email, I realized that he had already sent Dr. Reynolds a spreadsheet with some locations and categories. It was not comprehensive by any means, but it may serve as a starting point. Mr. Myrick asked me to send him a follow-up email on July 17, 2024. In that email, I will confirm that these location categories are appropriate; I will also include how much of the April 2024 data fits within each category:

1. 0 to 8000 (contains X birth locations, Y residence locations and Z clinic sampling locations)
2. 8001 to 22000 (contains X birth locations, Y residence locations and Z clinic sampling locations)
3. 22001 to 75000 (contains X birth locations, Y residence locations and Z clinic sampling locations)
4. 75001 to infinity (contains X birth locations, Y residence locations and Z clinic sampling locations)
