I emailed Justin Myrick yesterday regarding population categories for locations. He wants me to email him again next Wednesday because he is conducting fieldwork right now. I decided that, based off of what I have learned, I need to revisit all of my current work on this project to make it highly reproducible. All changes made to the raw data will therefore be included in the file ``main.R``. 

There are five things on my reading list today:

1. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-60942-2
2. https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0297905
3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233306
4. https://hdl.handle.net/11299/189222
5. https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/fullrefman.pdf

The data that Justin Myrick sent to Dr. Reynolds on April 18, 2024 is what I will be using for this analysis. Justin Myrick retrieved the data from the larger database on April 18, 2024, so it is the most up-to-date version I have.
