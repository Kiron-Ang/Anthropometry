I emailed Mr. Myrick for confirmation on these ranges:

- Category 1 = Village = Locations with a population size of 0 to 8000 
- Category 2 = Small Town = Locations with a population size of 8001 to 22000 
- Category 3 = Large Town = Locations with a population size of 22001 to 75000
- Category 4 = City = Locations with a population size of 75001 to infinity

I did not group the data I already have because I just realized that I have some inconsistencies between what I have found from searching the Internet for population sizes and what Mr. Myrick has given us from his 2022 work. I need to think about what to do here.
